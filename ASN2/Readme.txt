To compile emma-asn2.c, run the command gcc emma-asn2.c -o EMMA-ASN2

This should create an executable file named EMMA-ASN2

Proceed by running the command ./EMMA-ASN2

This should run the program starting with a prompt to enter a command.

Type in any command such as ls, ls -l, date, top, ps -ael, who, cal, history or exit.


Note: 
(1) commands are case sensitive, that is letters must be in lowercase.
(2) press 'q' to exit top command.

'exit' command will terminate the program.

'history' command will display the user's history of commands with the most recent command as the first command on the list.

'!!' command will display the most recent command and execute it via a new process.

Did not implement functionality for '!N'.
